*A GFS-like distributed file system for scalable and reliable storage.*  

PandaFS is a simple **distributed file system** based on the **Master-Slave architecture**, designed for **fault tolerance, replication, and security**. It ensures reliable data storage and retrieval across multiple nodes.  

---

##  Features  

- **Fault Tolerant** – Ensures data availability even if nodes fail.  
- **Replication** – Data is duplicated across nodes to guarantee eventual consistency.  
- **Secure** – 
    - Supports **client-side encryption** for secure storage 
    - **ACL** and  **token-based authentication** mechanism for unauthorized access.  
- **High Performance** – Supports parallel reads and writes for efficiency.
